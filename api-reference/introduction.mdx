## Welcome to Tu Pana API! ðŸ‘‹

We're glad to have you here. With this API you can issue electronic invoices in bulk and automatically using the SII invoicing system, without complications, without migrations, and in minutes âš¡.

Tu Pana is a friendly system designed for SMEs, accountants and backoffice teams who want to save time. You just need to upload the recipient data, generate your document, and issue it. We take care of the rest ðŸ˜Ž.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
